# Classlist

Given students' names along with the class that they are in, create a classlist
for the school.

In the end, you should be able to:

- Add a student's name and a class
  - "Add Jim to class 2."
  - "OK."
- Get a list of all students enrolled in a class
  - "Which students are in class 2?"
  - "We've only got Jim just now."
- Get a sorted list of all students in all classes.  Classes should sort
  as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a class should be sorted
  alphabetically by name.
  - "Who all is enrolled in school right now?"
  - "Class 1: Anna, Barb, and Charlie. Class 2: Alex, Peter, and Zoe.
    Class 3â€¦"
